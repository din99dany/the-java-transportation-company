Each class has its own service to perform different actions.

Each class has its own repo which is responsible for storing the data. 
 -The repos are all instances of a generic repo 

We have included in the GUI the following functionalities :
 — Quick access to orders, vehicles and routes
 — the possibility to quickly search for an order, by name or id
 — add new vehicles
 — route an order
